## Serving Suggestions

## Pro Tips

> **Chef's Secret:** For extra rich flavor, add a tablespoon of butter at the very end of cooking. This gives the sauce that glossy, restaurant-quality finish!

- **Make it ahead:** This dish tastes even better the next day! Store in the refrigerator and reheat gently.
- **Spice level:** Start with less cayenne and add more to taste. You can always add heat, but you can't take it away!
- **Chicken choice:** Thighs stay more tender than breasts, but both work great.
- **Dairy-free option:** Substitute coconut cream for heavy cream for a dairy-free version.

## Storage

- **Refrigerator:** Store leftovers for up to 4 days
- **Freezer:** Freeze for up to 3 months
- **Reheating:** Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of cream if needed
